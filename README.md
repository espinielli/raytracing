The code here is following the examples from Peter Shirley's books

* "*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*"
* "*Ray Tracing: The Next Week*"
* "*Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life*"

I tagged the different version according to Chapter where they have been introduced,
for example `weekend-06` is the code at the stage of Chapter 6 on Antialiasing 
in "*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*". The tags for the other books are `nextweek-xy` and
`alllife-xy`.
