The code here is following the examples from Peter Shirley's books

* "[*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*][oneweekend]"
* "[*Ray Tracing: The Next Week*][nextweek]"
* "[*Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life*][alllife]"

I tagged the different version according to Chapter where they have been introduced,
for example `weekend-06` is the code at the stage of Chapter 6 on Antialiasing 
in "*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*". The tags for the other books are `nextweek-xy` and
`alllife-xy`.
