The code here is following the examples from Peter Shirley's books

1. "[*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*][oneweekend]"
1. "[*Ray Tracing: The Next Week*][nextweek]"
1. "[*Ray Tracing the Rest of Your Life*][alllife]"

I tagged the different version according to book Chapter where they have been introduced,
for example `v1.6` is the code as of Chapter 6 (chapter `6`) on Antialiasing 
in "*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*" (book `1`). The tags for the other books are `v2.x` and
`v3.x`.
